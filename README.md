# Wildcard Project

You have a cool idea for an algorithms project? Use this repository. Make sure
to explain what problem you're solving, how you're doing it, and that you test
your code.


## Project Description
For my wildcard project I decided to try and compare the runtime of different languages namly javascript and python (I also used chatgpt to convert the code into c++ as well, just to how well an ai would write code). For the first part of my project so I started out by first taking my tsp held karp implementation and adding a timing function at the end that ran a through a fixed set of matricies 10 times each and then calculated the average. I made matricies with city sizes of 10-19 as those are the ones in my testing that ran in a reasonable amount of time. For my runtime tests I ran it on my own laptop thriugh wsl2 using Ubuntu.
